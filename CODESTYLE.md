# Code Style

The following is a general guide of how to structure your code. When contributing to Pulsarc it is preferrable that your code follows these guidelines.

**NOTE: Not all of Pulsarc's codebase may follow these guidelines exactly. We hope to make the code style as uniform as possible as time goes on.**

This guide is heavily inspired by [Quaver's Code Style Guide](https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver/blob/develop/CODESTYLE.md) and [MonoGame's Code Style Guide](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/CODESTYLE.md).

# Guidelines

## Tabs and Indenting ##
**DO NOT** use tab characters (\0x09)

**DO** use 4 space characters for each indentation.

### Braces
**DO** place open and closed braces on a new line.

**DO** ignore braces on single-statement blocks, unless it is to remove confusion in reading and to keep code-execution safe. 

**Good Example**
```cs
// Braces on separate lines
if (someExpression)
{
    DoSomething();
    DoAnotherThing();
}
// Braces to separate the inner else-statement from the outer else-statement
else if (anotherExpression)
{
    // No braces for single-statements that are easy to read.
    if (yetAnotherExpression)
        DoSomethingElse();
    else
        DoSomethingElseEntirely();
}
// No braces for single-statements
else
    DoSomethingIGuess();
```

**DO NOT** use one-liners.

**DO NOT** put braces on the same line as a expression.

**DO NOT** be inconsistent with your brace usage.

**Bad Example:**
```cs
// Opening Brace on same line as expression
if (someExpression) {
    DoSomething();
    DoAnotherThing();
}
// Inconsistent use of braces within this block
// No braces causes confusion between the inner else-statement and the outer else-statement
else if (anotherExpression)
    // Doesn't need braces a single-statement instead.
    if (yetAnotherExpression) {
        DoSomethingElse();
    // Closing brace on same line as expresssion
    } else
        DoSomethingElseEntirely();
// One liner
else { DoSomethingIGuess(); }
```

### Switches
**DO** indent ``case`` statements from the ``switch`` statement.

**Example:**
```cs
switch (someExpression)
{
    case 0:
        DoSomething();
        break;

    case 1:
        DoSomethingElse();
        break;
}
```

### Single Statements
**DO** ignore braces for single statement blocks following ``for``, ``foreach``, ``if``, ``do``, etc.

**DO** put the single statement on a new line and indent by four spaces.

**Good Example:**
```cs
for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
    DoSomething(i);

foreach (Item item in list)
   UseItem(item);
```

**DO NOT** ignore braces for single statement blocks that may be confusing to understand otherwise.

If you find yourself in a position where you don't know whether to include braces or not, use them anyway.

**Bad Example:**
```cs
// This chain could be easier to read with clarifying braces.
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 200; j++)
        if (someExpression)
            if (anotherExpression)
                foreach (Item item in list)
                    DoSomethingWeird(item, i * j);
            else
            {
                DoSomething(j);
                DoSomethingElse(i);
            }
        else if (yetAnotherExpression)
            DoSomethingPlease(j / i);
```

### Single line Property Statements
Single line property statements can have braces that begin and end on the same line. This should only be used for simple property statements. Add a single space before and after the braces.

**Example:**
```cs
internal class Foo
{
   internal int Bar { get; set; } = 10;
}
```

### Multi-Line Property Statements
Multi-line property statements must have braces on new lines.

**Example:**
```cs
internal class Foo
{
   internal int Bar
   {
      get => Bar * 2
      set { bar = value; }
   }
}
```

## Commenting
Comments should be used to describe intention, algorithmic overview, and/or logical flow.  It would be ideal, if from reading the comments alone, someone other than the author could understand a functions intended behavior and general operation. While there are no minimum comment requirements (and certainly some very small routines need no commenting at all), it is hoped that most routines will have comments reflecting the programmers intent and approach.

Comments must provide added value or explanation to the code. Simply describing the code is not helpful or useful.

**Example:**
```cs
    // Wrong
    // Set count to 1
    count = 1;

    // Right
    // Set the initial reference count so it isn't cleaned up next frame
    count = 1;
```

### Documentation Comments
**DO** use XML doc comments on all methods.

**DO** Fill out at least the ``<summary>`` of the XML doc comment.

**Example:**
```cs
public class Foo 
{
    /// <summary>This is my awesome method B)</summary>
    /// <param name="bar">What a neat parameter!</param>
    /// <returns>Some really cool stuff!</returns>
    public int MyMethod(int bar)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Comment Style
**DO** use ``//`` (two slashes) style of comment tags in most situations.

**DO** place comments above the code instead of besides it.

**Example:**
```cs
    // This is required for WebClient to work through the proxy
    GlobalProxySelection.Select = new WebProxy("http://itgproxy");

    // Create object to access Internet resources
    WebClient myClient = new WebClient();
```

## Spacing
Spaces improve readability by decreasing code density. Here are some guidelines for the use of space characters within code:

* **DO** use a single space after a comma between function arguments.
```cs
Console.In.Read(myChar, 0, 1);  // Right
Console.In.Read(myChar,0,1);    // Wrong
```
* **DO NOT** use a space after the parenthesis and function arguments
```cs
CreateFoo(myChar, 0, 1)         // Right
CreateFoo( myChar, 0, 1 )       // Wrong
```
* **DO NOT** use spaces between a function name and parenthesis.
```cs
CreateFoo()                     // Right
CreateFoo ()                    // Wrong
```
* **DO NOT** use spaces inside brackets.
```cs
x = dataArray[index];           // Right
x = dataArray[ index ];         // Wrong
```
* **DO** use a single space before flow control statements
```cs
while (x == y)                  // Right
while(x==y)                     // Wrong
```
* **DO** use a single space before and after binary operators
```cs
if (x == y)                     // Right
if (x==y)                       // Wrong
```
* **DO NOT** use a space between a unary operator and the operand
```cs
++i;                            // Right
++ i;                           // Wrong
```
* **DO NOT** use a space before a semi-colon. Do use a space after a semi-colon if there is more on the same line
```cs
for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)   // Right
for (int i=0 ; i<100 ; ++i)     // Wrong
```

## `var` vs Type
**DO** use the variable type.

**DO NOT** use `var`

## Naming
camelCasing - First word all lowercase, following words initial uppercase.

PascalCasing - All words initial uppercase.

Follow all [.NET Framework Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/) for both internal and external members. Highlights of these include:
* **DO NOT** use the Hungarian notation (including the type of the variable in the name)
* **DO** use camelCasing for private member variables. Underscore prefixing (e.g. ``_foo``) is allowed, but not required
* **DO** use camelCasing for other member variables
* **DO** use camelCasing for parameters.
* **DO** use camelCasing for local variables
* **DO** use PascalCasing for method, property, event, and class names.
* **DO** prefix interface names with ``I``
* **DO NOT** prefix enums, classes, or delegates with any letter.
